# Websocket UI Demo

This is a simple demo of how websockets can be used for status/progress updates in a web application.

It uses the [react-stomp-hooks](https://github.com/SvenKirschbaum/react-stomp-hooks#readme) to simplify the websocket connection and message handling.

## Running the demo

### Prerequisites

 - The [API server](https://github.com/rise8-us/websockets-api-demo) should be running.  

### Steps

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
